# üêç Python Crash Course: 21-Day Learning Log üöÄ

Welcome to my daily learning log for **Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition** by Eric Matthes!

My goal is to complete this fantastic book, chapter by chapter, in **21 days**. This repository serves as a public journal of my journey, documenting my daily learnings, code examples, challenges faced, and personal reflections.

## Why This Challenge?

As an Associate Software Engineer at Devsinc, I believe in continuous learning. This focused challenge helps me:

* **Deepen my Python fundamentals:** Reinforce core concepts and best practices.
* **Build a consistent learning habit:** Dedicate time daily to skill improvement.
* **Document my progress:** Create a tangible record of what I'm learning.
* **Share my journey:** Provide transparency and accountability, and potentially help others on a similar path.
* **Make learning interactive and memorable:** By actively writing and reflecting on each chapter.

## How This Repository is Organized

Each day of the challenge will have its own dedicated Markdown file (e.g., `Day_01_Log.md`), detailing the chapters covered and the key takeaways. All code exercises and projects for that day will be stored in a corresponding folder (e.g., `day_01_code/`).

* `Day_XX_Log.md`: Daily learning summary.
* `day_XX_code/`: Folder for Python script files and exercise solutions.

## Daily Progress Log

Here you'll find links to each day's learning summary.

* **[Day 01: Chapters 1 & 2 - Setup, Variables, & Data Types](Day_01_Log.md)**
