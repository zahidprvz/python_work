# The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work.
# When you're in the middle of working on a project, you understand how all of the peices fit together. But when you
# return to a project after some time away, you'll likely have forgotten some of the details. Using those comments, you can
# study your code and can understand what each segment was supposed to do
